# raydium-cp-swap

A revamped constant product AMM program optimized for straightforward pool deployment along with additional features and integrations:
- No Openbook market ID is required for pool creation
- Token22 is supported
- Built-in price oracle
- Optimized in Anchor

The program has been audited by [MadShield](https://www.madshield.xyz/). The report can be found [here](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-docs/tree/master/audit/MadShield%20Q1%202024).

The program assets are in-scope for Raydiumâ€™s [Immunefi bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/raydium/).
